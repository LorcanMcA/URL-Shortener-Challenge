# URL-Shortener-Challenge
A programming challenge for shortening URL's
By Lorcan McAnallen.

This challenge was for creating a service for shorterning URL's for use on site like twitter.

I decided to use ASP.net core 3.1 as it is open source, cross platform and user friendly framework.

The website uses Entity Framework Core which in turn uses the object-relational mapping (ORM).
The files in the solution contain migration files for setting up a new data base.
There is also a .BAK file in the Data/ServerBackupData folder if you want some premade accounts and links.

When creating the solution initally i spelt the word Shortener wrong (Shortner) so there are some references to the incorrect spelling.
